    question: "How does Omnisol AIâ€™s voice assistant function?",
    answer: "We utilize machine learning combined with advanced natural language that gives our assistants the ability to hold human-like conversations. This allows assistants to hold detailed conversations, ask and answer questions, and perform other functions as naturally as possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Will callers know they're speaking to AI?",
    answer: "Although we encourage transparency about AI, many clients have reported that their callers can't tell that they're talking to an AI assistant. This is because our assistants understand the flow of conversation, can recognize voice patterns, and are designed to sound human-like."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does integration take?",
    answer: "It typically takes 1 to 2 weeks for a basic setup to be completed while it may take 3 to 4 weeks for more complex integrations. Our team communicates with you throughout the entire process to ensure that they process is as seamless as possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure with Omnisol AI?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize my AI assistant's voice and personality?",
    answer: "Absolutely! There are countless choices available for personalities, voices, and accents to ensure that your assistant represents your business as accurately as possible. Voice cloning services are also available."
  },
  {
    question: "Which businesses benefit the most from Omnisol AI?",
    answer: "Businesses across all sectors benefit from our software. Although, customer service operations, sales departments, and service-based businesses with high call volumes have been found to benefit the most."
